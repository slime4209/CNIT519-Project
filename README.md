This project was divided into Project 1 and 2, where Project 2 was built upon the codes written for Project 1. I still need to fix some parts of the code, so it won't be perfect yet.

Project 1 Requirements

1. Code should ask user for a sentence and age of a person
2. Code should assess whether the sentence is a joke or not and analyze the joke to see if it creates humor through the use of homographs (words that are spelled the same but has different meaning)
3. Code should explain how the joke uses homographs to create humor
4. Code should assess the Age of Acquisition of the joke, aka. how old a person has to be to understand this joke

Example of homograph joke: How does the ocean say hello? It waves!
This joke is funny because the word "wave" has two meanings: "set waves in" and "signal with the hands or nod"


Project 2 Requirements
1. Code should be able to tell whether the joke creates humor through the use of homographs, homophones (words that are spelled differently but has similar utterances), or neither
2. If the joke creates humor through homophones, the code should assess the phonetics of the keywords and calculate their sound similarity

Example of homophone joke: I told my students I got stuck in a prison once. Turns out I just could not find my way out of a prism of light. 
This joke is funny because the words "prison" and "prism" have similar utterances.
